<h1>Magentix2 overview</h1>


<p>Multi-agent systems (MAS) are usually very complex systems, where both high-level
concepts (such as autonomy, coordination, ...) and low-level techniques 
(such as code mobility) are involved.<br></p>
<p> 
The main goal of the Magentix2 project is to develop a new open multi-agent platform 
suitable for the development of systems with all these requirements. The features of 
the Magentix2 platform can be structured in two basic levels, as follows:<br><br></p>

<p>
<I><B>Low-level architecture:</B></I> this level provides agent communication, interaction protocols
and basic agent Java classes.
Magentix2 is FIPA compliant and therefore, it can communicate to any other FIPA-compliant
platform.</p>
<p>
<I><B>High-level architecture:</B></I> this level integrates both multi-agent systems and service-oriented
technologies, providing support for virtual organizations. This architecture is called THOMAS 
(Methods, Techniques and Tools for Open Multi-Agent Systems).
<br><br></p>


<h2>Package once, install anywhere</h2>

<p>The Magentix2 installer it has been running successfully on Linux/i386, Linux/i686 and Linux/i86_64.
 All it needs is a Java[tm] Runtime Environment.<br></p>

<h2>Licence</h2>

<p>Magentix2 is published under the terms of GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3<br></p>
